Modern UI & Swipe to Delete
===========================
Modern UI adds various UI aspects found in iOS 8, like Compose View and Swipe to Delete in Mail, to Bug Reporter⁷. When swiping left on a bug, buttons are normally static. With Modern UI, buttons slide in as you move your finger (or mouse). And with Swipe to Delete, you can swipe even further to close, reopen or delete a bug without tapping on a button.

This is Modern UI. Included in MenzoMob.
